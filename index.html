          üëâ Atal Bihari Vajpayee was an Indian politician and poet who served three terms as the 10th Prime Minister of India, first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months from 1998 to 1999, followed by a full term from 1999 to 2004.

        <p class="main__p">
          üëâ Vajpayee was one of the co-founders and a senior leader of the BJP.
          He was a member of the RSS, a Hindu nationalist volunteer
          organisation. He was the first Indian prime minister not of the INC to
          serve a full term in office. He was also a renowned poet and a writer.

        <br />
        <p class="main__p">
          üëâ He was a member of the Indian Parliament for over five decades,
          having been elected ten times to the Lok Sabha, the lower house, and
          twice to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house. He served as the MP (LS)
          for Lucknow, retiring from active politics in 2009 due to health
          concerns.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="main__p">
          üëâ He was among the founding members of the BJS, of which he was
          president from 1968 to 1972. The BJS merged with several other parties
          to form the JP, which won the 1977 general election. In March 1977,
          Vajpayee became the Minister of External Affairs in the cabinet of
          Prime Minister Morarji Desai. He resigned in 1979, and the Janata
          alliance collapsed soon after. Former members of the BJS formed the
          BJP in 1980, with Vajpayee its first president.
